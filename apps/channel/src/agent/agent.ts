 * observable completes. BuiltInAgent clears its private abort controller later,
 * in its async cleanup, so reusing one instance can trip its reentry guard. This
 * facade leaves AbstractAgent.runAgent untouched and swaps only run(input), which
 * gives every invocation a clean inner agent without changing the shared
 * makeAgent factory.
